根据Adobe发言人Heather Edell的表述,这次事件一共有3800万活跃用户受影响:

	根据我们的调查可以确认,攻击者一共获取了大约3800万活跃用户的用户识别码和加密密码.我们已经完成对这些受影响用户的邮件提醒.同时我们重置了这次事故中所有这些用户的密码,无论这个用户是否是活跃用户.(So far, our investigation has confirmed that the attackers obtained access to Adobe IDs and (what were at the time valid), encrypted passwords for approximately 38 million active users.We have completed email notification of these users. We also have reset the passwords for all Adobe IDs with valid, encrypted passwords that we believe were involved in the incident—regardless of whether those users are active or not.)

她同时提到,对活跃用户的通知已经完成,对非活跃用户的处理工作正在进行中:

	我们依然在调查这次事故中涉及到的非活跃的,无效的和测试账号的数量.对非活跃用户的通知工作已经在进行中了.(We are still in the process of investigating the number of inactive, invalid and test accounts involved in the incident... Our notification to inactive users is ongoing.)

之前报道Adobe泄漏的源码包括Rader,Acrobat and ColdFusion.这次Edell承认部分Photoshop的源码也可能泄漏了:

	我们的调查表明部分,这次事故中,黑客也获取了部分Photoshop的源码.(Our investigation to date indicates that a portion of Photoshop source code was accessed by the attackers as part of the incident Adobe publicly disclosed on Oct. 3.)
